Today is the first day of the second class of the cpp which is the morning Zmansky class!

The first few week will be about CPP devlopers are now they navigate around their professional work enviorment 
Always do a git pull so that we have an up to date version of the code

For every lave
1, Accept assigment 
2. pull the assignemnt 

ALthough we are taought to use the name space thing we don't professionally so don't use it with Zmansky

In all languages there are files that are meant to compile for the user when typing in code when usijng built in functions 

In the old days when program to run it had to start at specific locations for example "loaction 100"

When we use g++ it does the relocatable thing which brings things things together 

I think that this happens when you run to programs at the same time and so the system will reconognize it as a reloactalbe 

The entire lesson kinda feels like porting thing out and in from Python 

The diffrent files sort of intertwin with one another and so they go to whatever file has the "main" function 


A certain file that I cannot rember should never have an functions in it only function sigantures. Possibly called the ".h file"


When you do an include with the angle brackets "this is something that CPP is provideing somthing that theh system is providing"

"It does a cut and past of lib.h"

#pragma once (id already added then the file won't be added again)
