Utils is dependet on adders and adders are dependent of dtils
Things that are compiled together that would end up in a result 

Even with a header fille -c is the one to give the .o file rather then compiling that thin completely

Then it appears that you would compile the .o files together and would be dependent on each other 

g++ *cpp compiles then everything that end in cpp but it is a deficeny disadvantage

"cp utils.cpp util-backup.cpp" is what he entered in order to ... I didnt catch this one

Make files are important so that things stay in sync 
for example:
///
adders.o: adders.cpp adders.h
        g++ -c adders.cpp
utils.o: utils.cpp utils.h adders.h
        g++ -c utils.cpp
main.o; main.cpp utilsh adders.h
        g++ -c main.cpp
mainL main.o utils.o adders.o
      g++ -o main main.o utils.o adders.o

clean:
      rm -f main.o adders.o utils.o
help:
      @echo "Targets;"
      @echo " main"
      @echo " clean"
      @echo " help"
//

Compling can take time
Make is powerfull becuase using can rebuild everything

All he had to recompile is the 2 to 3 files from the rom then the compling was much faster with Zman example of 3mins which was fast enough to be reasonable 

Make is primarlly from the C and the C++ tool world
There are many many many tools for C++ but conceptually they are all the same things you wanna build and how to get it done which is exactly what make does
Basic concepts are the same always combe back to make becuase it is just the simplest and it works 

If your confrotable with make then youll be in a good place to make right decsions.
