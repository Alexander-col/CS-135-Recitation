Going over more testing today and going over a work that we had gone over last semester (Piglatinify), 
-For look at the design specification 
-More thought and then actual application 
WHAT OTHER THINGS THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO TEST TO MAKE SURE THAT IT WORKS?
-Put in some test to see if it will pass or fail when comming along such as
  1) Words start with car
  2) non word input 
  3) Start with vowel
  4) Caps
  5) Empty string 
Listed 5 things here that could be tested when putting in the input 
If you really wantted to then you can make a test for each 
you can't test every single possiblibties simply just becuase there are just so many 


This is strict test written test development 
Zman personally does round based 

If youre a solo porgramer, but in the real world you have to aknowlege that your code might be around for a very long time
writing things into tests will help rember what tests have been established to see what passes and what fails 

Zman is showing off the example of "doctest.h" this is a files that likely contains mulitple tests to accomadate the many needed tests

(On the whilte board )
  n! = 1 * 2 * . . . n

#define DOCTEST_CONFI_IMPLEMENT_WITH_MAIN
#include <iostream>
#include "doctest.h"


TEST_CASE("Factorial Base Cases"){
CHECK(fact)(0) == 1);
CHECK(fact)(1) == 1);
CHECK(fact)(3) == 6);
}

Running two diffrent excutables that are unrealted to each other 
escutable porgam has nothing about the test there is nothing going on 

Most people like having function and then they have a seperate file to run on their tests (with the exception of Python)
There are very much diffrent type of testing even somthing that was called "Screenshot testing"
