Computer Number: C1001LAB2 202
Last time we talked about seperate compilations which applies to the new lab in which we are compling multiple files together

He is currently showing us the procedure that he uses when he is going through our work in order to grade it
Basically just follow instructions when submitting working 
Do not forget to implemnt the std::endl;

We can now write programs with more than just a single file 
In most cases we will be using the code from other people and so implement that into our own code 

If we go into the web development world at least from the front end that is, There is alot of things that are involved into this code 

Went over a bunc of commands in the terminal that I don't entirely understand g++ -o main main.cpp

If he had main.cpp then it really went to main.o
sepreate the .o and the fianlly likely when submitting it can change efficeny and ablity 

There is somthiing involved in which the command line is neccissay and cannot use the space bar instead

Today he had gone over using diffrent types of files and implementing them in a somthing called "Makefile" such 
it is on github: https://github.com/hunter-classes/135/blob/master/code/make/simple/Makefile

The power in this is that we are seprating conerns what if it is maing and 20 other files then so make only compiles the files that it needs to
